A web page is a single document on the internet that is part of a website.

Key Points:
Made using HTML, CSS, and sometimes JavaScript
Can contain text, images, videos, links, and forms
Has its own URL (web address)
Multiple web pages together form a website
Can be static (fixed content) or dynamic (changes based on user input)

Example:
www.example.com/about → About page of the website
www.example.com/contact → Contact page
