In programming, an IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment.
It’s a software application that provides everything a programmer needs to write, test, and debug code—all in one place.

Why IDEs are useful:
Save time by combining tools
Catch errors early
Make code easier to read and manage
Improve productivity, especially for large projects

Common examples of IDEs
Visual Studio Code (popular for many languages)
PyCharm (Python)
IntelliJ IDEA (Java)
Eclipse (Java and others)
Xcode (iOS/macOS development)
