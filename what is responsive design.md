Responsive design is a way of designing websites so that they look and work well on any device, whether it’s a desktop, tablet, or smartphone.

Key Points:

Adapts layout and content to screen size
Uses flexible grids, images, and CSS media queries
Improves user experience on all devices
Avoids horizontal scrolling or zooming
Important because people use different devices to access websites

Example:

On a desktop: a menu appears horizontally at the top
On a mobile: the same menu becomes a dropdown hamburger menu
