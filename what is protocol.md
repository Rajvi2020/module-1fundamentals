In a website, a protocol is the set of rules that tells your browser how to communicate with the web server.

You usually see it at the start of a website address (URL).

Example
https://www.example.com


Here, https is the protocol.

Common website protocols

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
Sends data between your browser and the website.
Example: http://example.com

HTTPS (HTTP Secure)
Same as HTTP, but encrypted for safety and privacy.
This is the standard today.
Example: https://example.com 

FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
Used to upload or download files, not usually for normal web browsing.
